Project Description

Our 'Gen Z chatbot' totally vibes with how Generation Z (born roughly between 1997 and 2012) chats when spilling tea or sharing the latest scoop. It‚Äôs fluent in all the slang Gen Z uses, plus it taps into their quick-fire, meme-filled communication style. It chats about all the celebs on social media, dishing on their drama, moves, or anything ‚Äòsuper sus‚Äô or ‚Äòlit‚Äô happening in the celeb world.

The Problem statement

Gen Z likes to talk, discuss, and share ideas. They are highly active on social media, often discussing trending topics, celebrity drama, and using unique slang. To engage them, a chatbot needs to adopt their language, stay current with their interests, and foster interactive conversations.

The Solution

We‚Äôve created a chatbot that speaks Gen Z‚Äôs language! It chats about celebs, their drama, and viral moments in the most relatable way. From ‚Äúspilling tea‚Äù to talking about ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs sus,‚Äù this bot is built to keep them engaged and coming back for more juicy gossip.
